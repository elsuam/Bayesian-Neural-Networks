\chapter{Conclusion}

Refer back to popular NNets and tell about the consumption and cost of data that was used to create them.  Compare them to BNN's (which ones of them are), and the potential for those that are not (i.e. what they would look like if they were)


Further research:
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
    \item Comprehensive review of activation functions
    \item Comprehensive review of loss functions
    \item Comparison studies of NN architectures for specific tasks
    \item Comparison studies of BNN's
\end{itemize}

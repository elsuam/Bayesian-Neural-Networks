\section{Introduction}
 In the Bayesian framework, training a neural network to minimize its error based on a single w is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood of the training data (i.e. finding weight w that maximizes $P(D_train|w)$. Therefore we can use Bayesâ€™ Rule to compute an interval of potential weights based on probabilities $P(w|D_train)$

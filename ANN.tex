Artificial neural network models of all kinds are the backbone of deep learning mechanics.  A common elementary application is to utilize a network to recognize and classify image date based on the pixel values








\section{The Architecture of Neural Networks} %-------------SECTION

Hint toward issues like overfitting, but elaborate more in section 2.3.

- Also, first mention \textbf{Optimization} here

\chapter{Introduction to Deep Learning}

Artificial intelligence is the start to outsourcing brain function to man-made machines.  A machine is said to have "Artificial Intelligence" if it can do what people say requires intelligence \cite{jackson2019introduction}, from counting monetary denominations to surveying Mars, playing chess games to converting human speech.  Within the realm of this is the subcategory known as machine learning, in which models are tested based on training data in order to "teach" them right from wrong.  Machine learning has an increased emphasis on the use of computers in statistical analyses and a decreased emphasis on proving confidence intervals around them \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}.  With astronomical advances in modern computing technology, creating elaborate learning models with raised functionality has become more and more accessible, creating a new category known as deep learning, which is the parent of the subjects within this thesis.  Deep learning models operate beyond those of traditional machine learning as such models contain layers of complexities, each performing a specific task for the overall objective.  Algorithms and procedures unite with complex mathematical formulas to generate extremely precise models without the assumptions of linear models.

\section{What is Deep Learning?} %-------------SECTION

Deep learning is the brand of machine learning concerned with using Artificial Neural Networks to reveal complex abstractions within data.
The evolution of the process of mimicking cognitive brain functionality within artificial machines dates back to the 1940's under the term cybernetics, which was originally intended to provide computational models for biological understanding \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}.  Since then, the history of what we now call "deep learning" has undergone waves of renaissance.
